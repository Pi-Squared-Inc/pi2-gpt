Abstract:
  A language-agnostic program verifier takes three inputs: a program, its formal specification, and the formal
 semantics of the programming language in which the program is written. It then uses a language-agnostic
 verification algorithm to prove the program correct with respect to its specification, using directly the formal
 language semantics. Such a complex verifier can easily have bugs. This paper proposes a method to certify the
 correctness of each successful verification run by generating a proof certificate for it. The proof certificate
 can be checked by a small proof checker. The preliminary experiments apply the method to generate proof
 certificates for the verification of an imperative language, a functional language, and an assembly language,
 showing that the proposed method is language-agnostic.
