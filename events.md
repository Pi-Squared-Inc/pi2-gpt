### Activities

#### Matching Logic: A Unifying Foundation for Programming

**Type:** talk

**Abstract:**
We present matching logic as a unifying foundation for programming, where programming languages and VMs are formally specified as matching logic theories; where various types of program properties are uniformly represented as matching logic claims; where formal correctness of program tools such as interpreters and formal verifiers is guaranteed by machine-checkable proof objects; and where an automated proof framework with best-effort proof strategies and heuristics is available. In the end of the talk, we highlight the promising future where traditional mathematical/logical proofs are combined with zero-knowledge proofs to achieve 100% assured trust, like never before.

### Activities

#### Universal, scalable and trustless verifiable computing

**Type:** talk

**Abstract:**
We are building a unique approach to verifiable computing that we call Proof of Proof. Pi Squared uses zero-knowledge (ZK) technology in a correct-by-construction and fundamentally unique way, which allows a universal and disarmingly small ZK circuit to provide verifiable-computing correctness guarantees to all languages and virtual machines (VMs) alike, without any translation to a common language, VM, or instruction set architecture (ISA).Pi Squared is building a Universal Settlement Layer (USL) powered by our Proof of Proof technology to make blockchain/language/application interoperability seamless and completely eliminate the need for traditional yet notoriously buggy language implementations such as compilers, transpilers, or interpreters.
